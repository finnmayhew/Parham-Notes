But seeing as it is the only fallen tree you've come across, I sense that it has piqued your interest if only for a fleeting second as it did mine so very long ago. Well come, come. Come look at the stump. Isn't it marvelous? You can see from the edges here that 'fallen' is indeed correct. Not 'felled'. That is very important. This tree fell of it's own volition. Now, look near the middle. Really look. If you squint hard enough, you'll see them. Oo there they are, about to go into that cave. Do you see it? Let's watch."
