> She’s a monster hunter.  She specializes in extraplanar monsters.  She developed this skill after studying extraplanar monsters that arrive at [[Buul]] — once they arrive, she captures them, studies them (as humanely as possible), and contains them until they’re hopefully picked up.

> She’s gained some notoriety from doing this, and looked to get noticed by [[Our Great House|our Great House]].  She figures that membership will grant her greater ability to travel in search of extraplanar monsters doing harm, and possibly she can train others to carry out her job when she’s no longer able.
